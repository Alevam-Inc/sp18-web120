        <h3>Therapy</h3>
        <h4>While I have studied the mind and explored many theories of relationship, change, and healing, I maintain the belief that each of us is the authority and expert on our own stories. And I think of therapy as a journey with you. </h4>        
        <p>I may have a specific map and will work diligently with you to point out landscapes and mile-markers. I may have indications of where we will travel together, but the destination is up to you. ​</p>
        <p>Understanding where you come from and the systems and relationships that have shaped you is important. So too is the theory that a therapist may choose to work within. I know that my own story and life experiences inform what I have chosen to study and how I practice. Psychodynamic theory is based in the relationship—in the belief that relationships shape us, harm us, and heal us. Our relationship will be used as a lens to the rest of your world. When appropriate, I will also draw from trauma theory, attachment theory, art therapy directives, and somatic practices to inform how you might look at the stories you bring.</p>
        <p>I hope to be a hospitable space to all of the parts of who you are, offering my attention to you with my gratefulness for the courage it takes to seek help from another person.</p>
