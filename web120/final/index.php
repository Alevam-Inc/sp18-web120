        <h3 class="hello">Whatever brought you, whoever nudged you this direction, however you come to find yourself here—you have landed for a moment, seeking help, a map, a fellow traveller, a friend. </h3>
        <p>Searching for a therapist or counselor—someone to simply sit with you and acknowledge with you that you are here can be a daunting task. In my experience, the courage required to look at yourself is courage well placed.</p> 
 
        <p>Welcome. I am glad you’re here.</p>
