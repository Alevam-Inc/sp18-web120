        Therapy is a collaborative process, one in which you and I jointly are curious about and engaged in exploring yourself. This will be the essence of our work together. After we are clear on your goals, we start the therapeutic process by creating safety, both a felt sense of a safe environment and a safe, supportive, non-judgmental relationship. I will listen deeply and carefully to you as we explore your history. I will be your guide, helping you to explore the expression of your emotional feelings, your thoughts and the images of your mind, and to learn to trust your inner felt experience. It is my job to stay well- attuned to your moods and physical sensations. We will learn how your past impacts the present and to see recurring themes and patterns in your life. We will explore our relationship with each other. We will first explore your strengths and resources, before we move into the more challenging aspects of your life. You will gain new cognitive, emotional, and body -based information about yourself and about your relations with others. I will always remain curious about who you are and what you need. You, in turn, will learn new skills, let go of old pain, and develop new ways of processing information and behaving so that growth continues outside of our sessions. In the language of neuroscience, our psychotherapy will enhance the growth and integration of the neural networks in your brain.        </p>

        You will find I weave together a variety of therapeutic approaches. I am a humanistic, psychodynamically-oriented therapist, but I primarily practice an interpersonal neurobiological or psychobiological approach, incorporating neuroscience, attachment theory, and the science of biological arousal and regulation.  This means I may weave into our therapy fabric ego-state therapy, self-psychology, somatic psychotherapy, feminist therapy, and brain-based therapies like EMDR. We may engage in Mindfulness practices. While each of these approaches has a somewhat different theoretical basis, all focus on helping you achieve a sense of authenticity and uniqueness. During the course of our work together, I hope you will develop fully or partially:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a sense of your vital self and your personal empowerment

</li>
            <li>a full range of interpersonal and life skills
</li>
            <li>a feeling of connection in relationships
</li>
            <li>an awareness of your choices and options in life
</li>
            <li>an expanded consciousness of and compassion for yourself and others
</li>
<li>a change in your presenting symptoms</li>
        </ul>

My goal is to help couples identify and change the internal and behavioral patterns that are obstacles to joy and intimacy in their relationship. Again, I utilize an interpersonal neurobiological approach, incorporating neuroscience, attachment theory, and the science of emotional and biological arousal and regulation.  At the same time, I am continuing to weave in Family of Origin and Family Systems therapies. During a session, we will often focus on the moment-to-moment shifts in your face, voice, and body, particularly as you are in relationship to each other. I will ask you to become very self-aware and also aware of the shifts in your partner as we discuss the strengths and challenges of your relationship. As in individual work, we will first focus on enhancing the strengths in your relationship before processing the challenges. We will explore your history as a couple as well as the attachment styles in each of your families of origin. Over time, we expect that you will create a more secure and positive relationship. Couples sessions are longer than individual sessions and, as such, may not be charged to your health insurance plan.
