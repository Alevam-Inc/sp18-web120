 <p>My name is Adam Nelson.  I am currently living in Tacoma. I learned early on that I loved to work with design and it seemed to come naturally to me. Designing logos is one of my favorite creative endeavors. I find it intriguing to find a way to  effectively communicate the brand or idea in one simple image. This is a very satisfying process for me. I previously attended <em>Bates Technical College</em>  where I obtained my <strong>Associates Degree in Digital Media</strong>. After graduation I began doing volunteer work at FabLab Tacoma. FabLab is a maker-space, where people can use 3D printers and other fabrication technologies without having to purchase any expensive machinery. I created a number of graphic design works for them, including flyers, posters, and brochures which advertised  events and classes. I have also edited photos and videos for FabLabâ€™s website. Now I am attending Seattle Central, with the goal  of a future career in web design. Web design merges my love of design with my interest in technology.</p>
